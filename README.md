Welcome to Court Vision this as a navite IOS app made for basketball entusiast. This app was made during my 4th semester where i was learning Smart Mobile. I came up with this idea since on of my pasions is Basketball and i thought that combining my passion and coding was a grate idea.
The app is more focused in taking new and allready experienced players to improve their skills in the game and more specifically the technicue such as shooting drubbling passing and more.

## Design 

In terms of designing i was aming for clean and minimalistic approach in order to be inline with Apple's design guidlines. Furthermore I have oppted for a design that is going to make the user a daily plan and will give a sence of comfort in the app. The homepage i have uncluded the most popular workouts and sections with workouts that are unfinised then there is the explore page where the user can unclude workoits to it daily activity.

Since i hade only four weeks for developing the app i had my concentraition on implemention a shooting exersize.
