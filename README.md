Welcome to Court Vision this as a navite IOS app made for basketball entusiast. This app was made during my 4th semester where i was learning Smart Mobile. I came up with this idea since on of my pasions is Basketball and i thought that combining my passion and coding was a grate idea.
The app is more focused in taking new and allready experienced players to improve their skills in the game and more specifically the technicue such as shooting drubbling passing and more.

## Design 

In terms of designing i was aming for clean and minimalistic approach in order to be inline with Apple's design guidlines. Furthermore I have oppted for a design that is going to make the user a daily plan and will give a sence of comfort in the app. The homepage i have uncluded the most popular workouts and sections with workouts that are unfinised then there is the explore page where the user can unclude workoits to it daily activity.

## Main feature 
Since i hade only four weeks for developing the app i had my concentraition on implemention a shooting exersize. Was when the user starts the workout the app is going to open the camera in order to record him and hi will perform his shooting if he does it correctly that will play a sound that indicated that the move was correct and subsequently a sound for doing the move wrong. 

## Coding 

In order to make the possible i had to use machene learning, i had to recod myself multiblie times doing the shooting move then this large data set was put in a software called ML Create that comes stock with the MacBook. The dataset was put in it in order to teach the model to accuratle recognize the motion the end result was teh the model was reqocnizing it 80% of the time.

After that it was time to put the model in the code and test it i can say that the reseult came out greate for demonstration purpouses i have left the areas where the model is looking in order to say that the motion was cussesfull bellow you can see small demo of the app and and how the Manchen learning model works:
